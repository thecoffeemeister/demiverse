  I like to imagine a future where quantum computing technology has become so prevelant that it has reached the point of personal computers, and ancestor simulations have become common enough that open source api's exist to create them.  And in this future some half-assed coder, in his basement of choice, makes a world all his own, just to dick around with.  This would be a world indistinguishable from our own.  Now what if this isn't the future but the distant past, and that simulation is our world.  To me, this would explain a lot.

  Anyway, the above description has little to do with this project, sorry to waste your time.  This project is more along the lines of a cellular automata making sweet sweet love to something a little like a qubit, but not really.  More my arm chair, pop-sci version of what I think a qubit might be. Anyway, it makes produces weird shit, and that is good enough for me.
